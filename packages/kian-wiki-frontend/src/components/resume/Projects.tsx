      </p>
      <p>
        I have revamped my website kian.wiki into a comprehensive platform for
        current and future projects, utilizing a monorepo structure for better
        scalability and integration. Lerna helps manage multiple projects within
        the monorepo, ensuring seamless collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform includes a Next.js-based front end for my resume, machine
        learning tools for football data analysis, and REST APIs for live sports
        information, all supported by shared libraries. Linting ensures a
        consistent codebase, aiding both new and existing developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        AWS Lambda functions are used to generate data periodically, which is
        then stored in S3. This precomputed data allows the Next.js front end to
        regenerate with the latest information. Next.js&apos;s Incremental
        Static Regeneration (ISR) re-renders pages whenever S3 data is updated,
        ensuring the site always displays current information.
      </p>
      <p>
        CI/CD is handled using GitHub Actions, with Jest ensuring code quality
        through comprehensive testing. TypeScript and Prisma ORM enhance
        development with type safety and efficient database management.
      </p>
      <p>
        AWS Amplify simplifies deployment and hosting, providing a robust
        infrastructure. This project significantly upgrades my previous website,
        transforming it into a versatile, high-quality platform for various
        applications.

      <p>
        Built a simple playground for a third person shooter leveraging Unreal
        Engine 5â€™s C++ implementations. This project was mainly important for
        honing object oriented principles, and it was just fun.

      <p>
        Developed a website using a React.js frontend, Node.js backend, and
        Postgres DB. Leveraged technologies such as Docker and Github Actions to
        create a playground for a preferred method of CI/CD; where a server
        instance could be tested, validated, and deployed securely and
        automatically.
